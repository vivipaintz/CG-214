Creativity and intelligence are just scratching the surface to what this ambitious woman has to offer. Some of her influences are artists like; Jackson Pollack, Willem de Kooning, Frida Kahlo and the words of Pablo Neruda. Her greatest influence has always been her mother. A strong woman who gave Vivian her depth of emotion and who always taught her to dream big and believe in herself.
