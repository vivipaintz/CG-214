        <h3>Ground Positions</h3>
        <center><p>Positioning is the foundation of ground fighting, if one combatant is physically clearly on top, such as if they are pinning the other combatant to the ground, then that combatant is said to have the top position, while the other combatant is said to have the bottom position. Top positions are usually dominant as fighters can use their weight to their advantage, but depending on the set of rules used, it can have notable exceptions such as the guard. A dominant ground position is usually easier to obtain for the person who initiated the throw or takedown. It may be possible for a fighter in a dominant position to score points or win by pinning their opponent, applying a Submission hold or striking.<br>Below are the 3 main ground positions.

        <h3>Submissions</h3><br><center><p>The majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: joint locks and chokes. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion. Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by submitting. Opponents can indicate submission verbally or they can "tap out" by tapping the opponent or the mat. (Tapping one's own body is dangerous because the opponent may not be able to tell if his or her opponent is tapping.) A choke hold, by disrupting the blood supply to the brain, can cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not submit soon enough.<br><!-- gif--><iframe src="//giphy.com/embed/l4KiaG7tNryejwwcE" width="480" height="270" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><br><br>

        A less common type of submission hold is a compression lock, where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock often also hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart.</p></center><br><div>Joint Locks:</div>
