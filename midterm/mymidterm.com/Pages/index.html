        <center><h2>Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a martial art combat sport that focuses on grappling and ground fighting. BJJ came to be because of the fundamentals learned from Kodokan Judo. Judo also known as Japanese jiu jitsu is a martial art that has been practiced since 1882. It was introduced to Brazil and the great Gracie family in 1914. The technique, skill, speed and endurance needed to train jiu jitsu is what's makes it such a dynamic and impressive fighting style.  <br></h2></center>

        <!-- Judo--> 
        <center><p>Before we discuss the history of BJJ I need to explain the origins of Judo. The objective of Judo is to throw or takedown an opponent to the ground, immobilize your opponent by pinning them down or to submit them with a joint lock or choke. Judo evolved into a combat sport and an olympic sport. Many rules were put in place to prevent the sport from becoming too violent. There were judo masters who brought their knowledge to Brazil.<br><br>
        <!-- Gracie-->
            BJJ eventually became it's own art through experiments, practice and adaptation. Some differences between the two are that BJJ has less rules. Spinal and cerebral locks/chokes are not allowed in judo.Carlos Gracie was one of the primary developers of modern Brazilian jiu jitsu. He eventually taught his brothers and extended family. His brother Helio Gracie developed his ground game that was very new. He was not a big man. He could not do the standing throws that were so popular in judo. It is because of Helio Gracie that a jiu jitsu match can begin on the ground as opposed to standing. Helio developed a style that made size irrelevant. He developed techniques that even if your opponent was larger than you in height or weight, you could still submit that opponent. These developments he made is why I believe jiu-jitsu is such a great sport for women. Below is a video about a great fight in history. Helio Gracie versus one of the greatest Judo masters <a href="http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/9/25/3350134/gods-of-war-masahiko-kimura-UFC-history-Helio-Gracie-judo-mma-history">Masahiko Kimura</a>. Kimura outweighed Gracie by 80 lbs and in this video you'll see a popular submission move that is now called the Kimura arm lock which i'll get into on the next page.</p><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gErppdxesiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
