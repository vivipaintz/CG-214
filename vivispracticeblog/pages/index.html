        <h2>Vivian Raquel Valentin is a contemporary artist based in <i>Brooklyn, Ny</i> and is an all around amazing human being.</h2> <p>I am <b>twenty five</b> years old and by now I feel very confident with a brush in my hand. I haven't been doing art steadily my whole life<br>but I've known I was creative and had a good eye my whole life.<h3>The following is a list of things I enjoy doing:</h3>
        <ul><li>painting</li><li>dancing</li><li>kickboxing</li><li>running</li><li>smoking weed</li></ul>
