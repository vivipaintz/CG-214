I really enjoy music whose wordss touch me and remind of personal experiewnce that garner a lot of emotion that inspires my work. I love listening to music while I work. The rhythm i have while dancing I like to mimic those movements when I paint. I use my body when I paint such did Jackson Pollock kwith his drip paintings. There was a method to his madness. there was rhythm and a system behinds his paintings that had no subject</h2></body>
