    <center><h1>Jiu Jitsu</h1></center>
    
    <p>So for my midterm I'm goingto be making a webpage about the fighting style jiu jitsu. I will be talking about the different practices of jiu jitsu. I'd like to include some links to my favorite fighting forums and also video clips of great fights from great masters. Jiu jitsu is about submitting your opponent using moves such as a rear naked choke, kimora, leg lock or armbar to list a few. It might be interesting to show clips of these specific moves and if im able to slow down the video to capture the move step by step. I'm going to talk about it's growing popularity in the United States due to organizations such as UFC and will also be discussing it's origins and the Gracie family that has made jiu jitsu what it is today.

    Judo also known as Japanese jiu jitsu was introduced to the great Gracie family in Brazil in 1914. Brazilian jiu jitsu is quite popular and unique. The strength, precision, speed and endurance needed to train jiu jitsu is what's makes it such a dynamic and impressive fighting style. It is not about striking. It is about submitting which takes being clever and patient along with being strong. I really believe that training martial arts is such a great way to keep your mind and body healthy. I'll also be adding links to great jiu jitsu and other mixed martial arts gym throughout New York.</p>
